# Open Password Manager

## WARNING
**Open Password Manager is not 100% safe like other similar software, so use it with your own risk.**
**I don't have no resposability of any trouble you can make using it**

## Description
Open Password Manager is an open-source password manager written in AutoIt v3 designed to help you keep your passwords and sensitive information secure. This application allows you to store, organize, and in future generate complex passwords securely.

## History
This project was born with the aim of providing users with programming skills a reliable and customizable tool to manage their passwords for free. I developed Open Password Manager with passion and dedication to offer an intuitive and secure password management experience.

## Language
Open Password Manager has been entirely developed using the AutoIt scripting language. This language allowed us to create an application in Windows that integrates well with the Windows environment and provides automation capabilities to simplify daily tasks.

## AES-256 Bit Security
The security of information is a priority. Open Password Manager uses AES-256 bit encryption to protect your stored passwords. AES-256 bit is a widely recognized and utilized encryption algorithm known for its speed and security. Your passwords are encrypted before being stored and can only be decrypted with your master key.

**EDIT: AES-256 Bit encryption is vulnerable to certain attack, so is not 100% safe, feel free to customize OPM with another algorithm**

## Key Features
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- Customizable for user with programming skills.
