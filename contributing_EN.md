This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project, ensuring a collaborative and respectful process for all participants.

## How You Can Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute, including:

* **Reporting bugs:** Help us make the project more stable by reporting bugs in a clear and detailed way.
* **Suggesting features:** Share your ideas for new features or improvements.
* **Writing code:** Contribute code to fix bugs, implement new features, or improve existing code.
* **Writing documentation:** Help make the project more accessible by improving the documentation.
* **Testing:** Test new features and fixes to ensure they work correctly.
* **Providing feedback:** Share your feedback on using the project.

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include the following information:

* **Clear and concise title:** Describe the problem briefly.
* **Steps to reproduce the bug:** Explain exactly what you did to trigger the problem.
* **Expected behavior:** Describe what you expected to happen.
* **Actual behavior:** Describe what actually happened.
* **Environment information:** Specify the operating system, software version (if applicable), and any other relevant information.
* **Any screenshots or logs:** If possible, include screenshots or logs that help illustrate the problem.

## Requesting New Features

When suggesting a new feature, please include:

* **Clear and concise title:** Describe the proposed feature briefly.
* **Detailed description:** Explain what the feature should do and how it should work.
* **Use cases:** Describe how this feature would be used by users.
* **Any ideas for implementation:** If you have any ideas on how it could be implemented, feel free to share them.

## Contributing Code

If you'd like to contribute code, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository:** Create a copy of the repository on your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the fork locally:** Download the forked repository to your computer.
3. **Create a branch:** Create a new branch from the main branch (usually `main` or `master`) for your changes. Give the branch a descriptive name (e.g., `fix-bug-login`, `add-new-feature`).
4. **Make your changes:** Write the code to fix the bug or implement the feature.
5. **Follow the code conventions:** Try to follow the code conventions used in the project. If they aren't explicitly defined, try to maintain a consistent style with the existing code.
6. **Write tests:** If possible, write unit tests or integration tests for your code.
7. **Document your code:** If you added new features or changed existing behavior, update the documentation.
8. **Run the tests:** Ensure that all tests pass.
9. **Commit your changes:** Commit frequently with clear and concise messages that describe the changes made. Follow a consistent commit style (e.g., [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)).
10. **Push your branch to your fork:** Push your modified branch to your GitHub repository.
11. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** From the page of your fork on GitHub, create a new Pull Request to the main branch of the original repository.

## Pull Request Guidelines

When creating a Pull Request, please:

* **Give it a clear and concise title:** Describe the changes made briefly.
* **Provide a detailed description:** Explain the problem it solves or the feature it adds. Include any additional information that might be helpful to reviewers.
* **Reference related issues:** If your PR fixes a bug or implements a feature requested in an issue, reference the issue in the body of the PR (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Implements #456`).
* **Keep PRs small and focused:** It's easier to review PRs that focus on a single problem or feature.
* **Be patient:** Reviewing PRs takes time. Be patient and respond to feedback from reviewers.

## Code Conventions

[You can add the specific code conventions for your project here. For example, you might specify the programming language, style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python), linters, and formatters to use.]

If there aren't any specific conventions defined, try to maintain a consistent style with the existing code.

## Code Review Process

All Pull Requests will be subject to code review by the project maintainers. The code review process aims to:

* Ensure code quality.
* Verify that the changes are in line with the project's goals.
* Provide constructive feedback.

Be open to feedback and willing to make changes to your PR based on reviewer comments.
