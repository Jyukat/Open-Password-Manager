# Open Password Manager

## Description
Open Password Manager is an open-source password manager designed to help you keep your passwords and sensitive information secure. This application allows you to store, organize, and in future generate complex passwords securely.

## History
This project was born with the aim of providing users with a reliable and customizable tool to manage their passwords for free. I developed Open Password Manager with passion and dedication to offer an intuitive and secure password management experience.

## Language
Open Password Manager has been entirely developed using the AutoIt scripting language. This language allowed us to create an application that integrates well with the Windows environment and provides automation capabilities to simplify daily tasks.

## AES-256 Bit Security
The security of your information is our top priority. Open Password Manager uses advanced AES-256 bit encryption to protect your stored passwords. AES-256 bit is a widely recognized and utilized encryption algorithm known for its robustness and security. Your passwords are encrypted before being stored and can only be decrypted with your master key.

## Key Features
- Secure password storage
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface
- AES-256 bit encryption for maximum security
